# DRF Question

The question:

- I closely followed the tutorial at: https://learndjango.com/tutorials/official-django-rest-framework-tutorial-beginners
- All goes well until I arrive at the chapter: Root API Endpoint
  - After updating the views.py with the reverse() functions, I end up with the error: `Reverse for 'user-list' not found. 'user-list' is not a valid view function or pattern name.`

I started this tutorial because I have the exact same problem in another project. I was hoping to learn in the tutorial what I did wrong.
So I am at a loss for how to get this to work...

PS. As far as I can tell, this is the official Django Rest Framework tutorial.
